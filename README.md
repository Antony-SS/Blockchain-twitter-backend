# My First Solidity Project - To allow music recs between users with chance of reward

This is my first blockchain project.  I am going to make this so users can interact with one another on the chain.  This interaction is still vague, but I want to take it in the direction of music reccomendations in the form of spotify/soundclould links.  

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
