# My First Solidity Project - To allow music recs between users with chance of reward

This is my first blockchain project.  I am going to make this so users can interact with one another on the chain.  This interaction is still vague, but I want to take it in the direction of music reccomendations in the form of spotify/soundclould links.  

Hardhat for the backend and used replit to make the frontend quicker to deploy - in the longterm I would consider moving this to a domain and server that I pay and host but for now that is too much for this small project.  Perhaps when I make my personal website/portfolio.
